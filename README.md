* **rtpsend**

	generated by hand or rtpdump
* **rtpdump**
	parse and print RTP packets,
	generating output files suitable for rtpplay and rtpsend
* **rtptrans**

* **multidump**
	Start multiple rtpdumps simultaneously.
* **multiplay**

## Installation

The RTP tools should compile on any POSIX-compliant
platform supporting sockets.

### UNIX

- If building from git, run the following first to regenerate the build tools:

```
aclocal
automake --add-missing --force-missing
autoconf
```

- Run `./configure` to configure rtptools for your system.
- Run `make` to build rtptools.
- Run `make install` to install.
- Run `make uninstall` to unisntall.

- Run `make rpm-spec` to create a spec file for a rpm package.
  Then run `rpmbuild -ba rtptools-*.spec` or `rpmbuild -bb rtptools-*.spec`
  on your rpm based distribution.


## TODO

* Fix type mismatch warnings.
* Fix building on windows.
* Generate a debian package.
